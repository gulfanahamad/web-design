    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <hr>
    <section><p>It is difficult to imagine how anyone ever gets a career started considering that you can’t get hired without experience you can’t get experience without being hired.<br>
Luckily, there is now the Internet. Sign up at one of the freelance websites like <b style="color:red;">goLance</b>. Through these sites, you can connect with employers from around the world who are always on the lookout for talented people at all skill and experience levels for all sorts of jobs.
To get hired for these jobs, you have to be easy to find. Create profiles on the freelance websites and make them shine. Add on to them by linking your social media accounts and writing about yourself and your background. Employers like to see the person behind the screen.
If you have little to no experience in your field, consider charging less money per hour than those with similar skills. This could get you the opportunities you need to earn experience. Do whatever it takes to make your self stand out online.<br>
Deciding to become a freelancer is like starting your own small business. Your online profiles are like your storefront. Everyday should be treated like a work day; work on honing your skills or improving your online visibility or making yourself more marketable. This dedication will pay off in the end; you will be prepared for the opportunities when they come.<br>
Freelancing can be a great way to find opportunities early on in your career, but it can make a wonderful full-time career as well. Think about it: you make your own hours, set your own rate, and work from anywhere. Bring your computer to the beach or the desert or the prairie or the mountain top. As long as you are doing good work and respecting your clients, you can create a lot of success as a freelancer.
I hope this has helped you. Please let me know if you decide to sign up with goLance. I like keeping up with people and seeing the different paths to success. Good luck!</p>
